# GCD of Big Integers
There are other choices, of course. Please implement a (non-negative) BigInteger data structure to
accompany with the two algorithms below. You can assume that all numbers would be no more than
256 decimal digits.

(1) (20%) Complete the GCD-By-Binary algorithm implemented in gcd by binary.cpp
by adding the necessary data description to biginteger for binary.h and writing a new le
biginteger for binary.cpp. Please feel free to add any other functions necessary, but you are
NOT allowed to modify gcd by binary.cpp. Your code should allow calculating the gcd of two
256-decimal-digit integers A and B from the standard input.

(2) (20%) Complete the GCD-By-Euclid algorithm implemented in gcd by euclid.cpp
by adding the necessary data description to biginteger for euclid.h and writing a new le
biginteger for euclid.cpp. Please feel free to add any other functions necessary, but you are
NOT allowed to modify gcd by euclid.cpp. Your code should allow calculating the gcd of two
256-decimal-digit integers A and B from the standard input.
