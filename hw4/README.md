# Decision Tree
In this problem, we will explore an application of trees in the area of Articial Intelligence and Machine
Learning. Decision Tree is one of the earliest tool for Machine Learning. The non-leaf nodes of a decision
tree represent choices (factors) considered, while the leaf nodes represent nal decisions under the choices.
For simplicity, we will consider the trees with binary factors|i.e., binary decision trees. Such a tree is
shown in Example 7.8 of the textbook.

For instance, the following tree1 is a binary decision tree for deciding whether to play golf. If the sky
is cloudy, we decide to play golf; if not, we check if it is windy|if so, we play golf only if it is not humid
and the sky is clear. On the other hand, if it is not windy, we do not play golf only when the sky is not
rainy but it is humid.
